			<p>The Volkswagen Passat (B8) is a mid-size car/large family car manufactured by Volkswagen that is available in a 4-door saloon and a 5-door estate body 			style sold as "Variant" in some markets. It was first introduced at the Volkswagen Design Center Potsdam on 3 July 2014. The B8 is the eighth-generation model in the Volkswagen Passat series and the first passenger vehicle of Volkswagen Group to be based on a stretched version of the MQB platform. The Passat Variant shares its platform with the Tiguan.</p>
			<p>A facelift model was announced in 2019, with minor exterior changes, updated engine line-up (the BiTDI engine was dropped), and updated interior, with touch controls for the multimedia and steering controls.
The B8 is assembled in the Emden and Zwickau Volkswagen production plants in Germany. Sales of European domestic market models began in November 2014.

The GTE, a plug-in hybrid version, was introduced at the 2014 Paris Motor Show for sale during the second half of 2015 in Europe.</p>
