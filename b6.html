			<p>The Volkswagen Passat (B6 & B7) is a front-engine D-segment large family car manufactured and marketed by Volkswagen from 2005 to 2010 (B6) and from 2010 to 2015 (B7, facelift). Respectively the six and seventh generation Passat, and internally designated B6 and B7, they were marketed in sedan and wagon bodystyles in front-wheel as well as all-wheel drive configurations, with a range of petrol and diesel engines.</p>
			<p>The B6 debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2005, and launched in Europe in the summer of 2005, using a long-wheelbase version of the fifth-generation Golf and Jetta, along with a transverse engine layout. B6 Passats were marketed globally, and superseded in North America by a model exclusively manufactured at Volkswagen's Chattanooga Assembly Plant.</p>
